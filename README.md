## Expression Converter

The Expression Converter is a C program designed to convert infix expressions to postfix and prefix forms. It utilizes a stack-based algorithm to perform the conversion efficiently. This tool finds applications not only in general programming tasks but also in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), particularly in expression evaluation and parsing algorithms.

### Functions:

1. **precedence**: Determines the precedence of operators (+, -, *, /) in the expression.

2. **infixToPostfix**: Converts an infix expression to postfix form using a stack-based algorithm.

3. **reverseString**: Reverses a string, used for converting infix expressions to prefix form.

4. **infixToPrefix**: Converts an infix expression to prefix form by reversing the infix expression, converting it to postfix, and then reversing the result.

### Features:

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: Converts infix expressions to postfix form.

- **Infix to Prefix Conversion**: Converts infix expressions to prefix form.

- **User Interaction**: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to input infix expressions and select the desired conversion.

- **Multiple Conversions**: Supports converting multiple infix expressions to postfix or prefix forms in a single session.

### Usage:

1. **Select Conversion Type**: Choose between converting infix expressions to postfix or prefix form.

2. **Enter Infix Expression**: Input the infix expression that you want to convert.

3. **View Result**: View the converted expression in either postfix or prefix form.

4. **Repeat or Exit**: Choose whether to convert more expressions or exit the program.

### Benefits:

- **Efficiency**: Utilizes stack-based algorithms for efficient conversion of infix expressions.

- **Flexibility**: Supports conversion to both postfix and prefix forms, providing versatility in expression handling.

- **User-Friendly**: Offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the program.

- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness and stability during conversion.

### Application in DSA:

The Expression Converter plays a vital role in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for tasks such as expression evaluation, parsing, and conversion. It serves as a fundamental tool in implementing algorithms like the Shunting Yard Algorithm and evaluating arithmetic expressions efficiently.

This summary outlines the key features and functionality of the Expression Converter, highlighting its significance in both general programming tasks and DSA applications.
